  * Loading indicator/spinner on submit.
  * Sidebar collapsible in mobile view.
  * Display AI response indicator (typing.../responding...).
* **Post-Question Flow:**

## ⚙️ Deployment Requirements

---

## 📈 Final Notes for Developers

* All premium checks tied strictly to `has_paid` status in `UserProfile`.
* Guests have fully separate chat flows (session-based).
* Maintain modularization for each feature area.
* Enforce strict permission controls in APIs.
* Use DRF ViewSets/serializers for consistency.
* Optimize file upload processing and audio generation.
* Ensure accurate frontend rendering with state management and responsive UI.
