take your time and let's break things down, 1. when the questions are mcqs the check boxes for the answers are not created. and when they are theory, the text area is not created for users to answer. 2. when i close the questions box or card, it doesn't appear as the button we discussed. 3. for the ask for explanation feature, just send a prompt like explain why this is the 'answer' to the 'question' and get a response in chat 4. save you answers and do a direct comparison for mcqs and a logical comparison with theory questions and at the end of the questions provide a submit button for user to submit their answers. then their score is displayed. save their score into local storage so they can see their scores. 6. for visuals kindly render the images well so users can see. it clearly. 
it worked perfectly, now let's do this. 
some fixes before we continue to the other features finish fast then we work on the payment plan.
 so first of all. at the top of the page i am seeing 'welcome undefined' fix that. 
2. on page reload, the question pop up is the first thing i see, which is not ideal, remove that.
3. the chat button should disappear after you have finished answer the questions. 
if you want it again you have to go to the inventory. 4. in the inventory, there is no download button.
5. for the chat input field, let it grow as the lines of text grow, to a certain limit say five lines, 
and the send button should be an icon inside the input field and when click it should be loading or 
change form like a circular load, the input field should be rounded and nice, use the ui components for that,
it's nice, and also in mobile view the side bar should disappear and there should be a button to toggle it's 
appearing and disappearing. also when the ai response is being rendered on the page an indicator
like typing... or respond... should be displayed.
lastly I want custom spinners for page loading and stuff. after this we continue.
